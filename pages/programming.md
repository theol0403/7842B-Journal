# Programming Journal

Hello! I'm **Theo Lemay**, and this is my **digital programming journal** for
the 2020/2021 **Change Up** season.

My primary role on the team is to design **driver controls**, design autonomous
**motion control algorithms**, and design and develop **autonomous skills
routines**. I also assist with building and driving.

This season, I have invested the majority of my time on three major tasks:

### Programming Skills

- Design and implement a **programming skills run** that is consistent and fast.

### Intake Control

- Develop an intuitive and versatile **driver control scheme** for the robot
  intakes that make it easy to drive.
- Implement a **statemachine** controller that combines driver and sensor input
  to achieve smooth and intuitive ball handling.
- Use sensors to **automate features** like autopooping, which is the automatic
  disposal of unwanted balls.

### Motion Control

- Develop smooth, repeatable, and powerful **motion algorithms**, for fast and
  optimal navigation during autonomous.
- Use sensors to **improve reliability**, like **localization**, **vision
  seeking**, and **velocity control**.
