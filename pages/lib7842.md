# lib7842

### What is lib7842?

lib7842 is a PROS library for advanced controls which is built around OkapiLib. It is designed to be a good example for advanced programming and a useful tool for competition.

I have been working of lib7842 since summer 2019, and plan on releasing it to the VEX community by summer 2020. I will use it for competition through the season, which will not only provide testing and experience, but also provide a direction and motivation for the library. 

I have shared the library with some teams in the US who are part of TVA for testing and collaboration purposes. 

### What will lib7842 provide?

The core of lib7842 will be:

- [x] Fluent path generation API
- [x] Pure Pursuit path follower
- [ ] Pure Pursuit X-Drive path follower
- [x] Odometry-based PID motion controller
- [x] Odometry-based PID X-Drive controller
- [ ] Flexible GUI library
- [ ] Vision sensor management and filtering

There are other utilities and functionality in lib7842, but these are the main elements of it.

### Programming Practices:

lib7842 is a full library that will be used by many VEX competitors. To deliver the best product possible, I am learning how to follow the best C++ coding standards and practices for lib7842.

- **Git**
  - Make a commit for every change made
  - Use imperative tense for commit messages
  - Use git flow for source and feature management
- **Formatting**
  - Format all code using clang-format
- **CI and Tests**
  - Tests need to be made for each public API
  - Each commit is compiled and tested by Azure Pipelines
  - **CI Results**
    + V5 binary and template
    + Test results
    + Valgrind memory leak detector results
    + Callgrind profiler results
    + CppCheck static analysis
    + Codacity static analysis
    + Codefactor static analysis
