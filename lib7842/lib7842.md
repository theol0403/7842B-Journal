# lib7842

lib7842 is a library I am developing for the VEX community. I will be developing it throught the season and hopefully have it released by the end of the year. 

It will consist of:

- [x] jhj
- [ ] 

### Best Practices:

- **Git**

  - Make a commit for every change made
  - Use gitmoji to indicate commit intent
  - Use imperative tense for commit messages
  - Use git flow and make feature branches for large improvements
- **Code Style**
  - Use const references when passing values
  - cppcheck
- **Formatting**
  - Formatting is handled by clang-format-9
  - Install a clang-format package into your editor so you can format as you type
- **CI and Tests**
  - This project uses Google Test and OkapiLib mocks
  - Tests need to be made for each public API
  - Each commit is compiled and tested by Azure Pipelines
  - Results from CI include:
    - V5 build logs and template
    - Test build logs and results
    - Valgrind memory leak detector results
    - Callgrind profiler results
    - CppCheck static analisys
    - Codacity static analisys
    - Codefactor static analisys
