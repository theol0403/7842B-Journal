Upon analysis of the most optimal driver skills run, we realized the biggest
factor that was impeding our time: we were pooping too early. We had always
driven so that the robot would try to get rid of blue balls right away, which
would keep the intakes empty. However, the blue balls that were pooped was
causing pandemonium in the field, and knocking balls out of the way.

We realized that the best driving runs were repeatable and clean - dealing with
a randomly jumbled field was not a good strategy.

### The solution

If the robot held the blue balls and waited for a better time to poop, the blue
balls would not cause the field to be jumbled.
