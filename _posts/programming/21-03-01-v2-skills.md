For the competition of March 6, we plan to score all the goals. This would grant us a massive score thanks to completing all the combos. However, some improvements needed to be made from the last autonomous:

- the starting orientation was not ideal to set up, and it often caused the robot to knock the nearby ball into the way
- at this point, the motion algorithms now support strafing and arcing, making many more routes possible
- vision sensor alignment has been implemented, and seems to be very effective at improving consistency
- planning locations where the robot poops is very important to ensure the field is in a consistent state
- improving the intake timing is key

## The new routine

Keeping all the above points in mind, here is the new routine:

Where **B** is the start, **E** is the end, and <span style="color: #26d761; font-weight: bold">green</span> is point turns. In this run, there are 13 point turns.
