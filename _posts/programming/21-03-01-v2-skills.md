Previously, our routine was only designed to score a maximum of 122 points (out of 126), purposefully excluding 4 of the balls. It looked something like this:

Where **B** is the start, **E** is the end, and <span style="color: #26d761; font-weight: bold">green</span> is point turns. In this run, there are 13 point turns.

We are only slightly under time, so in order to get the last 4 balls, something needs to be different. Simply modifying the current routine to grab the last 4 balls is not possible.
