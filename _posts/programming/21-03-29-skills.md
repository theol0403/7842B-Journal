I need to find the best programming skills routine. Considerations:

- point turns are slow and prone to error
- reducing the number of separate motions and optimizing for long, smooth motions is ideal
- the locations where the robot can dispose blue balls (poop) must be carefully selected to not collide with other balls
- goals can be used to realign the robot

## Old Routine

Previously, our routine was only designed to score a maximum of 122 points (out of 126), purposefully excluding 4 of the balls. It looked something like this:

Where **B** is the start, **E** is the end, and <span style="color: #26d761; font-weight: bold">green</span> is point turns. In this run, there are 13 point turns.

We are only slightly under time, so in order to get the last 4 balls, something needs to be different. Simply modifiying the current routine to grab the last 4 balls is not possible.

## New routine

Here are a few ways we can shave off time and make it possible to get the last 4 balls:

- Robot V3 can intake the blue balls from the center tower rather than needing to poke them out. This can save us about 8 seconds.
- Spending less time at each goal and perfecting the shoot/intake timing can save us about 5 seconds.
- Adding a hood catapult to the robot can allow us to quickly score our preload, saving us about 3 seconds
- Redesigning the entire autonomous to be more efficient, with the last 4 balls in mind, and reducing point turns, can save us about 10 seconds.

For the last point, the more complex the motions are (driving while turning, complex arcs), the more optimal the routine can be.

One possible routine:

Where **B** is the start, **E** is the end, <span style="color: #f01b44; font-weight: bold">red</span> is translation, <span style="color: #138ffb; font-weight: bold">blue</span> is front-facing direction, <span style="color: #26d761; font-weight: bold">green</span> is point turns, and <span style="color: #64e6e7; font-weight: bold">light blue</span> is potential "poop" locations. The <span style="color: #ffda3a; font-weight: bold">star</span> is a hood catapult. In this run, there are 11-12 point turns.
