I need to find the best programming skills routine. Considerations:

- point turns are slow and prone to error
- reducing the number of separate motions and optimizing for long, smooth motions is ideal
- the locations where the robot can dispose blue balls (poop) must be carefully selected to not collide with other balls
- goals can be used to realign the robot

## Old Routine

Previously, our routine was only designed to score a maximum of 122 points (out of 126), purposefully excluding 4 of the balls. It looked something like this:

Where **B** is the start, **E** is the end, and <span style="color: #26d761; font-weight: bold">green</span> is point turns. In this run, there are 13 point turns.
