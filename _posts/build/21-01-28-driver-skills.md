## First ideas

Our plan for a starting score is to be able to get one red ball in each goal and
only get out necessary blue balls. We did this to get a high score without
having to do as much scoring. By not scoring multiple balls in each goal which
would seem more efficient we got combo points which are worth a lot more.

The combos are worth six points each and with there being eight combos they are
worth th majority of points. Since we didn't have enough time to score all the
balls the easiest way to get a high score is to get combos. By only taking out
one blue ball in th center and putting one red in each goal the score is
already 106.

We managed to score 112 driving score using this and getting a few extra balls
scored.

## Ideas with robot v2

For the next competition we used dual controllers so that one could drive and
score and the other could try to take out the blue balls from the goals to
increase the score we also tried to go for scoring a few extra red balls. With
these changes we managed to score 117 points at the next competition.

For the next competition we changed it to have auto pooping to get rid of the
blue balls and we got a score of 120.
