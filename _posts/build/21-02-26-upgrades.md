## Intakes
For the new robot we decided to speed the intakes and shooting up. We made the top roller that shot the ball faster and lowered the amount of compression on the ball. This made it shoot better and not take as much pressure to shoot. We changed it to 1200Rpm. We also increased the rest of the intake and other roller speed to 600Rpm. This made the time to intake and score a lot faster.

The original hood that put compression on the ball to shoot but was not very secure, so we changed the hood to a more solid position. The hood is attached with a hinge and has a solid stop place which helped shoot better. We had some issues getting the right compression to solve this we took a slow-mo video of the robot shooting. We saw in he video the ball was spinning so it was not getting launched as far so we used that to adjust the hood compression.



## Base
We also changed the wheels from 2.75 inch to 3.25 so that we could have higher speed to be able to do a full skills run.
